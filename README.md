# Overwatch-Outlines

**Outlines** is a simple tool written in modern C++ that will display Player through Walls.

## Why ?

Why not?. I also cba for the Code(Clean Code etc) **Also its not the safest and best method so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## How to Use ?

1. Download the DLL from the release site.
2. Use a Injector of your choice!
3. Start up Overwatch and enjoy!

## How to Build ?

Simple, **Clone the Repository** and **open the Solution**, *you may need some SDK's as we are using C++ Version 17*.
To actually *Build* the Project all you have to do is select the **Release Configuration** and... well... *build it*.

## License

I have decided to put this Project under **Public Domain**!
