# Overwatch-Outlines

**Outlines** is a simple tool written in modern C++ that will display Player through Walls.

## Why ?

Why not?. I also cba for the Code(Clean Code etc) **Also its not the safest and best method so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## How to Use ?

1. Download the tool from the release site.
2. Execute the batch file.
3. Start up Overwatch and enjoy.!

**Note:** `If you build the project yourself, it is recommended to use the same injector as the one used in the batch file or any injector of your choice.`

## How to Build ?

Simple, **Clone the Repository** and **open the Solution**, *you may need some SDK's as we are using C++ Version 17*.
To actually *Build* the Project all you have to do is select the **Release Configuration** and... well... *build it*.
